Developed an end-to-end equity prediction and automated trading system on S&P 500 data. The pipeline uses state-of-the-art sequence models and domain-specific features to generate return forecasts, while a reinforcement-learning policy executes trades under transaction-cost and risk constraints. In backtests, the system achieved approximately +7% cumulative return.
