Participated in a drug-discovery competition on IC50 prediction (half-maximal inhibitory concentration). I developed a transformer-based regression pipeline for tabular molecular/assay features, incorporating careful feature engineering and k-fold cross-validation for robust generalization. The final system placed in the top 2% on the leaderboard.
