Participated in a 4D block classification competition with images captured across varied backgrounds and perspectives. I designed a background-invariant, two-stage approach: an object detector localizes the block to remove background bias, and a high-capacity image classifier predicts the structure. With cross-validation, strong augmentation, and an ensemble at inference, the system achieved a top 9% accuracy on the leaderboard.
